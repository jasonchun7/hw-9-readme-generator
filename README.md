## Homework 9: Professional README Generator

## Description

For this week's homework, we were assigned to create a README Generator all from the command line using Node.js. Since there were some starter code to start with, it was not too difficult to complete. As this is the first back-end assignment we worked on, it was very interesting what we can do with one of the back-end languages like Node.js and just shows me what else we can do with it.

## Installation

Since this is a deployed assignment, you'll have to fork or clone it from my GitHub Repo, which I included below:

- [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/jasonchun7/hw-9-readme-generator)

## Usage

It's very simple: Once you've cloned or forked it, you'll have to npm install the 'inquirer' and 'axios' modules to start from the terminal (or gitbash). Then, enter 'node index.js' in the terminal (gitbash).

## Credits

Working with Node.js was both fun and challenging at the same time. Hence, I referenced a lot of my code and questions from youtube videos, and StackOverFlow (who doesn't...).

## Demo

Here is the link to the short demo video of the application: [Demo Video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IJhsyogdboBKmERt60vP5XdbBF0oWcA6/view?usp=sharing)
